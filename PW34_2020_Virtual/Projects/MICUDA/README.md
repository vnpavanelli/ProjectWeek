# MICUDA - Mutual Information with Extensive Entropy and CUDA

## Key Investigators

# Project Description

MICUDA is a tool to register images using mutual information and generalized entropies (Tsallis and Renyi) with GPU acceleration.
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

1. Improve the registration range of ITK and 3D Slicer using generalized entropies
2. Provide a faster registration tool for realtime applications
3. Move towards a fully automated tool for batch registration (e.g. medical atlas generation)


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Presentation on monday (5 minutes):
    - Show a little demo of fast registration using GPU
    - Talk about the problems found in the ITK Mattes metric how to solve them
    - Discuss some mathematical visualization of the metrics output and how to find local extrema that challenges registration with it

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
